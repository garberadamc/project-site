## Finite Mixture, Latent Variable, & Structural Equation Modeling 





# Analytic workflow strategy:

### - The R pacakge {`MplusAutomation`} is used for creating organized project workflows (Hallquist & Wiley, 2018)
### - All models are esitated in Mplus allowing for highly flexible SEM model specification (Muthén & Muthén, 1998-2017)
### - R-Projects and the {`here`} package allow for reproducability across operating systems.
### - The {`tidyverse`}'s highly coherent functions are used whenever possible to increase accessibilty for applied audiences (Wickham et al., 2019)

# Implementation strategy rationale:

### 1. Why not use a package in R to estimate S.E.M models? 

#### - Currently, most S.E.M. packages in R such as {`lavaan`} have significant limitations in their capacity for flexibly specifying the full range modeling approaches available in S.E.M. This includes the ability to specify categorical latent variables (LCA/LPA/LTA), multi-level models (MLM), non-normal outcomes (GLM), and their combinations (i.e., multi-level LTA with covariates & distals). 

#### - Other packages, although highly flexible {`OpenMX`} are less accessible to applied researchers. 

### 2. Why not do S.E.M. modeling  entirely in Mplus? 

#### - Running complex models in Mplus is error prone due to the workflow involving a proliferation of files and reliance on other software (Excel, SPSS). 
#### - In practice, this results in organizational challenges and lots of copying and pasting.
#### - Importantly, Mplus does not provide convenient methods for conducting fully reproducable research projects. 
#### - In R documenting all research decisions and data presentation is straightforward from start to finish (e.g., data cleaning, transformation, re-coding, plotting, and table construction).
